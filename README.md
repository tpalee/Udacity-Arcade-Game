## Playing the game

**Traveling through space is dangerous...**

Control the alien spaceship with your arrow-keys on your keyboard.
The goal of the game is to travel through space from one platform to the other,
trying to avoid the meteors and enemy-rockets.
When the player has reached the platform 5 times, victory is achieved.
