<UL>
<strong>Traveling through space is dangerous...</strong><br>
Control the alien spaceship with your arrow-keys on your keyboard.<br>
The goal of the game is to travel through space from one platform to the other,<br>
trying to avoid the meteors and enemy-rockets.<br>
When the player has reached the platform 5 times, victory is achieved.
